                    <p>Smelling the cold, fresh air of the night right as I walk into my job chills me in a way that’s unlike most. I take out my earbuds and open the door, my boss is standing there, holding my paper count. “213,” it reads. “What the fuck man.” I mistakenly blurt out. “Use that fucking language in here again and I’ll end you son, end you!” My boss says. I grab the paper and go to the backroom where all the newspapers are and grab my 213 in a struggle. I stuff them into my sack and head for the exit. On my way out, these other boys are standing there talking. As I go by them I put my head down, “Yeah bro it was right next to my crib.”  “No way! Was that shit hot?” They say to each other as I keep it moving. I don’t think anything of it. I mean, these boys are probably talking about fucking their cousin in the alley between their townhouses. Nothing I want a part of. I hop on my bike and start pedaling pretty fast. I’m thinking about what I’m going to do after work and how much weed I’m going to buy with all of my tip money. 213 papers is a lot. But at least it comes with a reward. I just have to get it over with quickly so I can go get that reward. I usually start my night out riding by the same place. There are always these kids in front of the parking garage drinking their forties and smoking their cigs. I remember my first night, I didn’t toss these kids a paper and they started shouting at me to toss them one. They chased me down the block until I just let go of my sack and let them have all the damn papers. I didn’t smoke too much that night. But I always toss them one now. Even if it’s a Wednesday and all I have are a few blackbook ads for gardening supplies and jobs. I keep riding and eventually get to the kids. I notice a little book of matches on the ground of the sidewalk and I pick them up. No store is going to sell me a lighter, so I’m thinking this’ll come in handy after the shift. I toss them a paper and keep it moving, expecting at least one of them to call me a pussy or something. But they instead direct their attention towards this man in a suit walking by them on the sidewalk. The man didn’t do or say anything, just walked right by them. I think one of the kids might’ve called him something, but he didn’t bat an eye. He walked right in the parking garage at such ease. Something was weird about that. It seems like this man had set out to do nothing less but to reach that door. Every footstep was loud. The wind felt colder than usual. Chills on my arm started to appear. It was hard not to think about it as I kept pedaling and delivering papers. My regulars were all over the place tonight. Every door I throw a paper to, it seems like someone is on their front porch just waiting to give me money, and my cash is stacking up quickly. The folks usually stay put on their porch and I toss them one, and if they’re real, they’ll call out for me to come up and grab some mula from their palms. I keep riding with about a little less than half of my papers left for the night. The cold air starts to make my nose leak. The lights of downtown Kalamazoo pierce my eyeballs with such fervid intensity. I can barely keep my eyelids from closing. I near the end of my route and see a man and woman down the street I’m on. As my eyes regain strength I start to make out their shape. Their shape is moving. I slow down my pedaling and stop. This couple is running full speed at me. They get closer and closer and finally come to a halting stop as they reach me. Their clothes are dripping and their mouths are wide open panting heavily. “Can we please get a newspaper man, please? How much?” The guy asks me. “Three bucks bro,” I say. He snatches the paper out of my hand and forcefully replaces it with three krinkled up one dollar bills. They open up the paper and start reading. Meanwhile, I am staring at them, with those same chills from earlier all over my body.</p>

                    <p>I whip my sack over my shoulder and continue to ride. My pedals seemingly harder to push, I continue on with my route. I don’t know why this couple wanted a paper so badly. Their words sliced me into a million pieces. The million pieces they were sliced into when they went through whatever it is they went through. It was obvious something was wrong and it had just happened. I didn’t want to think about it any longer. As I continue to ride, my focus is distant. Everything is blurry around me and the lights of the night don’t crawl under my skin anymore. I am seeing in pixels. Little lines and shapes that make up this world. I look around me, and then look forward. I regain my focus and notice flickering lights down the street. The lights are changing rapidly. Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue. As I ride closer, “Kalamazoo Police Department'' started to read clearly. I move forward ever so carefully trying to make out the scene. Blood is on my tires. The drips of red are splashing up onto my pant leg as I look down. I whip my head towards the sidewalk and there is the same man from earlier, dead. His body is smashed on the sidewalk with his head hanging from his neck and limbs mangled into a million directions. Blood is on the window. Blood as high as 20 feet off the ground. It was a mess. Police officers all turned their heads and looked over as I went by. The cold stares mixed with the chills going through my body made me shake to my core. Something was wrong with this picture, incredibly wrong. I had seen this man earlier and thought he had a goal, I had met this couple who raced towards my moving bike seeking out one of my worthless papers, I didn’t get heckled by these dumbass kids who heckle everyone constantly. What is today? What is so special about today? I pedal on back to the shop. The trip back seemed endless. My bike’s chain was falling off and was making all these terrible noises. “Creak! Crank! Skrrrrttt!” I get to the shop and park my bike. I have a few papers left and I know that means my boss is going to complain about the “in-efficiency of the night,” or the “lack of motivation on my part.” Instead, he isn’t there. The shop is empty and quiet as a dead cricket. I know the boss has a few cigs in his desk drawer. I plop my sack on his desk and grab a cig from below. I grab the pack of matches that I found from before out of my pocket and spark the cig. I look around at my boss’s office. My sack lies next to me, and I open it up after staring at this piece of fabric for ages. The papers in a heaping mess, I grab one and pull it out. With the paper on my lap and the cig lodged between my knuckles, I look at the front page in astonishment. I shove the paper back into my bag in a rush and sit there. The traffic from outside begins to slowly grow louder. My cigarette reaches the filter and I toss it into the ashtray on my boss’s desk. I sit there silently, as I contemplate my night.</p>
